        <h2>About Environmental Awareness</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Environmental awareness is the understanding of the importance of preserving and protecting the environment. It includes recognizing the effects of human activity on the planet and taking steps to reduce harm. By being more conscious of our actions, we can reduce pollution, conserve natural resources, and ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.</p>
            <p>Many of the issues we face today, such as climate change, pollution, deforestation, and biodiversity loss, stem from human activity. It's critical that we not only understand these challenges but also take meaningful steps to combat them.</p>
